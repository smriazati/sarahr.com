    <h1>Web Development &amp; UX Design</h1>
    <p class="large-text-style">
      I design user interfaces and develop front-end code with an emphasis on
      accessibility, animation and performance optimization. I love
      collaborating with designers to produce bespoke websites that load quickly
      on any device and look beautiful in all browsers. I work with clients to
      create seamless editorial workflows and custom content management systems.
      I build websites using a variety of tools, include Vue, Sanity, Netlify,
      Wordpress, Shopify and GSAP.
